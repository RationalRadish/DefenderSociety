# Defender Society Website

Created for the Ignite Louisville challenge.

Hosted on www.bbbsky-alumni.org.

The code has three main branches:
1. Sandbox dev - used to develop the local development 
   of the website. Runs on local host.
2. Docker-dev - created to dev out the docker deployment on the 
   local machine. 
3. Docker-prod - used to push to the remote server. Currently 
   hosted on digital ocean. 
   

The project uses poetry to install packages. The pyproject.toml
and poetry.lock files are provided to re-create the packages 
to your local environment.
